# PunnettSquares
This program _will_ be able to calculate Punnett Square for multiple genes. This program only works for normal dominant and recessive traits. It is no where near finsihed though. This is still in early stages.
  
Hopefully in the future I can add things like codominance, multiple alleles, and etc.
